# TkStrike Middleware Documentation
## Purpose
The purpose of the TkStrike Middleware is to provide a layer between Freescore 5â€™s OVR and TkStrike. TkStrike exposes a WT OVR API that implements an events listener and venue manager. The middleware will interpret data from the OVR and send it to TkStrike accordingly.
